# Portfolio

The following is a list of my work contributions during my time with various companies. As an iOS Engineer, I didn't build entire apps on my own. Instead, I collaborated closely with a team, where each of us had specific responsibilities for different features. The portfolio below highlights my individual contributions, which span across Core/Infrastructure, Security, and Feature-related areas.

#### üè¢ iOS Infra Stuff
::: item-details Enablement of Linux Runner in Gitlab-CI for `danger-swiftlint`
Since we can run `Swift` in Linux by using `Swift Toolchain`, I enabled `danger-swiftlint` to run on a CI Linux Runner.<br><br>
![Danger-SwiftLint](/portfolio/port_sb_danger_lint.png){width=500}<br>
The process was significantly faster on Linux, completing in just `38 seconds`, compared to over `3 minutes` on Xcode Cloud CI.<br><br>

::: item-details `SwiftLint` Quarantine Strategy to resolve thousands of Lint Violation
To address the numerous `SwiftLint` violations scattered across hundreds of files in our project, I'm introducing a new approach known as the **Quarantine Strategy**.<br><br>
![Quarantine Diagram](/portfolio/port_sb_swiftlint_quarantine_diagram.png)<br>
The Quarantine Strategy involves classifying files into two categories: healthy and infected. To maintain the integrity of healthy files, we enforce `danger-swiftlint` on every Pull Request. Simultaneously, we work to reduce the number of infected files over time.<br><br>
